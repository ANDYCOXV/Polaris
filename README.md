# Polaris Robotics Vanguard 2017-2018
At Vanguard I was Team Captain of the Robotics Team and served as the team programmer. Our team participates in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). This repository holds some of the code and notes that I saved for next years class some of the files had to be compressed to zip files to save on storage space.
