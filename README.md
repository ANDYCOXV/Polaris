# Polaris Robotics Vanguard 2017-2018
At Vanguard I was the robotics team captain (team Polaris 13053) and served as the team programmer as well. Our team participated in FIRST Tech Challenge. This repository holds some of the code and notes that I saved for next years class. Some of the files had to be compressed to zip files to save on storage space.
