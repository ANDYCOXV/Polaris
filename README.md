# Polaris Robotics Vanguard 2017-2018
At Vanguard I was the Robotics Team Captain and served as the team programmer as well. Our team participates in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC - Team Polaris 13053). This repository holds some of the code and notes that I saved for next years class. Some of the files had to be compressed to zip files to save on storage space.
